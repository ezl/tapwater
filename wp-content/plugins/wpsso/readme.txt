Make sure your content looks great on all social and search sites - no matter how your URLs are crawled, shared, re-shared, posted, or embedded.

== Description ==

<p style="margin:0;"><img class="readme-icon" src="https://surniaulula.github.io/wpsso/assets/icon-256x256.png"></p>

**Make sure your content looks great on all social and search sites - no matter how your URLs are crawled, shared, re-shared, posted, or embedded:**

WPSSO Core and its complementary add-ons create meta tags and Schema markup for Facebook / Open Graph, Google's Knowledge Graph, Google Rich Results (aka Rich Snippets, Structured Data), Mobile Web Browsers, oEmbed data for LinkedIn, Pinterest Rich Pins, Twitter Cards &mdash; including complete markup for image SEO, video SEO, extensive e-Commerce product markup (for WooCommerce and others), mobile store apps, author profile / authorship, co-authors, publisher information, local business markup, aggregate ratings, reviews, recipe information, event details, and much, much more &mdash; all from your existing WordPress content, supported plugin data, and service API data.

There's no need to manually re-enter descriptions, titles, product information, re-select images / videos, etc. like other meta tag and Schema markup plugins &mdash; WPSSO Core reads all your existing post, page, image, video, e-commerce product, recipe, rating, review, event, and SEO content automatically.

WPSSO Core is also language / locale aware, which means you can customize several option values for different webpage languages.

**Coded for maximum performance:**

WPSSO Core makes full use of all available caching methods &mdash; along with offering advanced caching features like pre-seeding in background. WPSSO Core and its complementary add-ons load only the libraries and classes they need, keeping their code small, fast and light. All code is fully tested and compatible with the latest version of WordPress and PHP v7.x (WordPress v4.2 and PHP v5.6 or newer required).

<h3>Users Love the WPSSO Core Plugin</h3>

&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; &mdash; "This plugin has been a lifesaver in terms of making our images and links and descriptions look beautiful everywhere we post them! Itâ€™s so easy to use and the preview functions are incredibly helpful." - [lotusblooms](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/love-this-plugin-789/)

&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; &mdash; "What a fantastic plugin. If you want to fix all the errors in search console for structured data, this is the plugin to use. Love it." - [goviral](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/makes-schema-so-easy/)

&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; &mdash; "This plugin saves me so much time, and it has really lifted my SERP rankings. Most of my keywords I now rank 1-3 position. I also noticed after about a week that my impressions have gone up at least 75%. I upgraded to the pro version which gave me even more options." - [playnstocks](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/excellent-plugin-and-support-200/)

&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; &mdash; "Yoast on steroids! As an SEO marketer, I love using Yoast for my basic on-page SEO. But Yoast only allows you to enter basic Open Graph social settings. This plugin gives you SO many more options on completing the Open Graph for Facebook, Twitter cards, Pinterest etc. If you use WordPress, I totally recommend using this plugin to help with better rankings in the SERPS!" - [gregmontag](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/yoast-on-steroids/)
